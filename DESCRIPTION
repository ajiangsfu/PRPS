Description: This package calculates classification prediction score with three method choices: 
   a) LPS (defult, Linear Prediction Score); 
   b) PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score);
   c) PS (Prediction Strength).
   In the classification step, if LPS is chosen, Empirical Bayes' probabilities are calcualted 
   and classification is based on cutoff on probabilities; if PRPS is chosen, two types of outputs
   are given: one is based on cutoff on Empirical Bayes' probabilities, the other one is based on 
   natural cutoff 0 on PRPS scores; when PS is selected, by default, classification is based on 
   natural cutoff 0 on PS scores, however, a separate function can alos issues classification based
   on cutoff on Empirical Bayes' probabilities when necessary.
