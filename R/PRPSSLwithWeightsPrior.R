#' PRPS score calculation and binary classification for a testing data set without training data set, but with selected feature weights
#' and a ratio prior
#' @description This is the function to calculate PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score) scores for a testing data set 
#' without training data set. However, we do need selected feature list with their weights. In addtion, we need mean and sd for two groups for each
#' selected feature that we need to apply a ratio prior with default as 1/3 to achieve. Once we have PRPS scores, we will use the 
#' theoretic natual cutoff 0 of PRPS scores to make classification calls, as well as classification calls based on Empirical Bayesian probabilities
#' with EM (Expectation-Maximization) and with a ratio prior.
#' @details  This is the function to calculate PRPS scores and make classification for a testing data set with known weights and a ratio prior of choice.
#' PRPS calculation is based on Ennishi 2018, its formula is:
#' \eqn{PRPS(X_i) = \sum (|a_j| log(P1(x_ij)/P0(x_ij)))}
#' Here, a_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x_ij is the corresponding feature value
#'  for the ith sample, 
#' P1 and P0 are the probabilities that the ith sample belongs to two different group.
#' However, in order to calculate P1 and P0, we need to have two group mean and sd for each selected feature. Although there are multiple way
#' to obtain these values, in this function, we design to use a ratio prior to achieve group mean and sd, which was used in Ennishi 2018 originally.
#' After we have have the scores, the natural cutoff of 0 is used to make classification calls as well as empiracal Bayes probability based classification
#' with the ratio prior.
#' 
#' In addtion, we design to use EM algorithm to get PRPS score mean and sd calculation for the two groups assuming that PRPS score
#' is a mixture of two normal distributions.
#' 
#' When calculate a Empirical Bayes' probability, we first calcualte probability that a sample belongs to either group,
#' and then use the following formula to get Empirical Bayes' probability:
#' \eqn{prob(x) = p_test(x)/(p_test(x) + p_ref(x))}
#' Here prob(x) is the Empirical Bayes' probability of a given sample, p_test(x) is the probability that a given sample
#' belongs to the test group, p_ref(x) is the probability that a given sample belongs to the reference group.
#' Notice that the test and reference group is just the relative grouping, in fact, for this step, we often need
#' to calculate Empirical Bayes' probabilities for a given sample from two different standing points.
#' 
#' Within this function, standardization step is included as an option to minimize the difference 
#' between training and testing data sets, be aware that standardization step should be consistent between the data used 
#' for weight calculation and the testing data set. 
#' Also, be aware that this step is only done to make distributions of each selected
#' features comparable. Be aware that this feature-wise standardization cannot make the sample-wise distributions
#' comparable. For example, if the proportion of one group over all samples might be much lessin the testing data set 
#' compared to the data that were used for weight generation, or even worse, the testing data set might only contain one classification 
#' group only, in this case, feature-wise standardization can not solve the comparison problem. 
#' This is the common problem for classification and feature-wise standardization cannot solve the problem. 
#' In order to solve the problem, we should make data comparable as much as possbile before classification step.
#' 
#' @param newdat a new data matrix or data frame, columns for samples and rows for features
#' @param weights a numeric vector with selected features (as names of the vector) and their weights
#' @param standardization a logic variable to indicate if standardization is needed before classification 
#'  score calculation
#' @param classProbCut  a numeric variable within (0,1), which is a cutoff of Empirical Bayesian probability, 
#'  often used values are 0.8 and 0.9, default value is 0.8. Only one value is used for both groups, 
#'  the samples that are not included in either group will be assigned as UNCLASS
#' @param ratioPrior a prior ratio to indicate the ratio of test group over reference group 
#'   regarding mean and sd calculation for each selected feature
#' @param PRPShighGroup a string to indicate group name with high PRPS score
#' @param PRPSlowGroup a string to indicate group name with low PRPS score
#' @param breaks a integer to indicate number of bins in histogram, default is 50
#' @param EMmaxRuns number of Iterations for EM searching; default=50
#' @param imputeNA a logic variable to indicate if NA imputation is needed, if it is TRUE, NA imputation is 
#'  processed before any other steps, the default is FALSE
#' @param byrow a logic variable to indicate direction for imputation, default is TRUE, 
#'  which will use the row data for imputation
#' @param imputeValue a character variable to indicate which value to be used to replace NA, default is "median", 
#'  the median value of the chose direction with "byrow" data to be used
#' @return A list with two items is returned: PRPS parameters for selected features, PRPS scores and classifications for the given samples.
#' \item{PRPS_pars}{a list of 4 items, the 1st item is a data frame with weights of each selected features for PRPS
#'  calculation, the 2nd item is a numeric vector containing PRPS mean and sd for two groups based on a given priorï¼Œthe 3rd item 
#'  is a data frame contains mean and sd for each group and for each selected feature based on a given prior, and the 4th
#'  item is a numeric vector containing PRPS mean and sd for two groups based on EM}
#' \item{PRPS_test}{a data frame of PRPS score, classification and two groups' Empirical Bayesian probabilites based on a given prior,
