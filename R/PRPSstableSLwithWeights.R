#' PRPS stable self-training 
#' @description This function is to calculate PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score) scores and 
#' make binary classification calls for a testing data set without PRPS training object. It involves a self-training 
#' process with given features and their weights.
#'
#' @details This function is trying to get reasonable PRPS based classification without training data set, but with 
#' selected features and their weights. The actual steps are as following:
#' 1) assume that we have a pool for group ratio priors such as seq(0.05, 0.95, by = 0.05) for default ratioRange = c(0.05, 0.95)
#' 2) With given features and their weights
#'    a) for each prior in 1), call PSSLwithWeightsPrior with given features and weights to achieve PRPS scores
#'       apply EM on PRPS scores with Mclust, get 2 group classification
#'    b) define the samples that are always in the same classes across searching range as stable classes
#' 3) repeat step 2) but this time with opposite signs in the given weights, result in another set of stable classes
#' 4) get final stable classes that are common in 2) and 3)
#' 5) use final stable classes to get group means and sds for each feature and for each group
#' 5) calculate PRPS scores
#' 6) Once we have PRPS scores, we could use the theoretic natual cutoff 0 to make classification calls, which may or may not appropriate. 
#' Alternatively, with two groups based on stable classes assuming that PRPS score is a mixture of two normal distributions, 
#' we can get Empirical Bayesian probability and make calls
#' @param newdat a input data matrix or data frame, columns for samples and rows for features
#' @param weights a numeric vector with selected features (as names of the vector) and their weights
#' @param plotName a pdf file name with full path and is ended with ".pdf", which is used to save multiple pages 
#'  of PRPS histgrams with distribution densities. Default value us NULL, no plot is saved.
#' @param ratioRange a numeric vector with two numbers, which indicates ratio search range. The default is
#'  c(0.05, 0.95), which should NOT be changed in most of situations. However, if your classification is very
#'  unbalanced such as one group is much smaller than the other, and/or sample variation is quite big,
#'  and/or classification results are far away from what you expect, you might want to change the default values.
#'  c(0.15, 0.85) is recommended as an alternative setting other than default. In an extreme rare situation, c(0.4, 0,6) could a good try.
#' @param stepby a numeric parameter for distance between percentage searching step, it should be within (0,1), default value is 0.05, 
#'  but a user can change it to other values such as 0.01
#' @param standardization a logic variable to indicate if standardization is needed before classification 
#'  score calculation
#' @param classProbCut a numeric variable within (0,1), which is a cutoff of Empirical Bayesian probability, 
#'  often used values are 0.8 and 0.9, default value is 0.9. Only one value is used for both groups, 
#'  the samples that are not included in either group will be assigned as UNCLASS
#' @param PRPShighGroup a string to indicate group name with high PRPS score
#' @param PRPSlowGroup a string to indicate group name with low PRPS score
#' @param breaks a integer to indicate number of bins in histogram, default is 50
#' @param imputeNA a logic variable to indicate if NA imputation is needed, if it is TRUE, NA imputation is 
#'  processed before any other steps, the default is FALSE
#' @param byrow a logic variable to indicate direction for imputation, default is TRUE, 
#'  which will use the row data for imputation
#' @param imputeValue a character variable to indicate which value to be used to replace NA, default is "median", 
#'  the median value of the chose direction with "byrow" data to be used
#' @return A list with two items is returned: PRPS parameters for selected features, PRPS scores and classifications for the given samples.
#' \item{PRPS_pars}{a list of 3 items, the 1st item is a data frame with weights of each selected features for PRPS
#'  calculation, the 2nd item is a numeric vector containing PRPS mean and sd for two groupsï¼Œthe 3rd item is a data frame contains mean and sd
#'   for each group and for each selected feature based on stable classes}
#' \item{PRPS_test}{a data frame of PRPS score, classification and two groups' Empirical Bayesian probabilites based on stable classes, 
#' and classification with natural 0 cutoff}
