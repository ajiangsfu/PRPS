#' Self learning binary classification with selected features and their weights
#' @description This function is to calculate PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score) scores and 
#' make binary classificationcalls for a testing data set without PRPS training object. This function involves a self learning 
#' process with weights + priors + EM + Bayes but no need to input a group ratio prior. However, we do need selected feature list
#' with the feature weights, and we use self learning method to estimate mean and sd for two groups for each selected feature 
#' in order to calculate PRPS scores. Our original idea in JCO 2018 does requrire a group ratio prior to do so,
#' which is written as PRPSSLwithWeightsPrior function in this package. We also have another function: PRPSSLwithWeightsEM, 
#' which uses EM to estimate group mean and sd for each selected feature. In this fucnction, however, we combine the ideas in both
#' of the above two functions to achieve our new version of self learning algorithm.
#' @details This function is trying to get reasonable PRPS based classification without training data set, but with 
#' selected features and their weights. It combines ideas from PRPSSLwithWeightsPrior and
#' PRPSSLwithWeightsEM, which we call it as self learning algorithm, the actual steps are as following:
#' 1) assume that we have a pool for group ratio priors such as: seq(0.05, 0.95, by = 0.05), this will give us 19 ratio priors
#' 2) for each prior in 1), call PRPSSLwithWeightsPrior to achieve PRPS scores
#' 3) apply EM on PRPS scores from 2) with Mclust, which includes 2 group classification
#' 4) use the samples that are always in the same groups to get group means and sds for each feature and for each group
#' 5) calculate PRPS scores
#' 6) Once we have PRPS scores, we could use the theoretic natual cutoff 0 to make classification calls, which may or may not appropriate. 
#' Alternatively, we can also apply EM to calcualate mean and sd for the
#' two groups assuming that PRPS score is a mixture of two normal distributions, followed by Empirical Bayes' probability 
#' calculation and final binary classification calls.
#' PRPS calculation is based on Ennishi 2018, its formula is:
#' \eqn{PRPS(X_i) = \sum (|a_j| log(P1(x_ij)/P0(x_ij)))}
#' Here, a_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x_ij is the corresponding feature value
#'  for the ith sample, 
#' P1 and P0 are the probabilities that the ith sample belongs to two different group.
#' However, in order to calculate P1 and P0, we need to have two group mean and sd for each selected feature. Although there are multiple way
#' to obtain these values, in this function, we design to use EM algorithm to achieve group mean and sd assuming that each selected feature
#' is a mixture of two normal distributions. 
#' After we have PRPS scores, we provide classification calls based on theoretic 0 cutoff and based on probability, which may or may not appropriate
#' for this function since it is based on self learning. To calculate a Empirical Bayes' 
#' probability to make classification calls, we also need to apply EM to get PRPS score mean and sd for two groups. 
#' After that, we can calcualte probability that a sample belongs to either group,
#' and then use the following formula to get Empirical Bayes' probability:
#' \eqn{prob(x) = p_test(x)/(p_test(x) + p_ref(x))}
#' Here prob(x) is the Empirical Bayes' probability of a given sample, p_test(x) is the probability that a given sample
#' belongs to the test group, p_ref(x) is the probability that a given sample belongs to the reference group.
#' Notice that the test and reference group is just the relative grouping, in fact, for this step, we often need
#'  to calculate Empirical Bayes' probabilities for a given sample from two different standing points.
#' @param newdat a input data matrix or data frame, columns for samples and rows for features
#' @param weights a numeric vector with selected features (as names of the vector) and their weights
#' @param standardization a logic variable to indicate if standardization is needed before classification 
#'  score calculation
#' @param classProbCut a numeric variable within (0,1), which is a cutoff of Empirical Bayesian probability, 
#'  often used values are 0.8 and 0.9, default value is 0.9. Only one value is used for both groups, 
#'  the samples that are not included in either group will be assigned as UNCLASS
#' @param PRPShighGroup a string to indicate group name with high PRPS score
#' @param PRPSlowGroup a string to indicate group name with low PRPS score
#' @param breaks a integer to indicate number of bins in histogram, default is 50
#' @param EMmaxRuns number of Iterations for EM searching; default=50
#' @param imputeNA a logic variable to indicate if NA imputation is needed, if it is TRUE, NA imputation is 
#'  processed before any other steps, the default is FALSE
#' @param byrow a logic variable to indicate direction for imputation, default is TRUE, 
#'  which will use the row data for imputation
#' @param imputeValue a character variable to indicate which value to be used to replace NA, default is "median", 
#'  the median value of the chose direction with "byrow" data to be used
#' @return A list with two items is returned: PRPS parameters for selected features, PRPS scores and classifications for the given samples.
#' \item{PRPS_pars}{a list of 3 items, the 1st item is a data frame with weights of each selected features for PRPS
#'  calculation, the 2nd item is a numeric vector containing PRPS mean and sd for two groupsï¼Œand the 3rd item is a data frame contains mean and sd
