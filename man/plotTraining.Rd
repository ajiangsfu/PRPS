\title{Plot function for training objects}
\usage{
plotTraining(trainObj, plotName, xshift = -0.05, yshift = 0.02,
  breaks = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{trainObj}{a training object from LPStraining, or PRPStraining, or PStraining}

\item{xshift}{a numeric variable to indicate how much value shift along x-axis to move the label position for the natural 0 cutoff point,
default value is -0.05, which is used for ROC plot}

\item{yshift}{a numeric variable to indicate how much value shift along y-axis to move the label position for the natural 0 cutoff point,
default value is 0.02, which is used for ROC plot}

\item{breaks}{a integer to indicate how many cells in the histogram}

\item{plotNanme}{a string variable to indicate the file name to save, it should includes path and plot file name (without .pdf part)}
}
\description{
This is to plot ROC and hist for a given training object, and scatter plot if the training object us from LPStraining or PRPStraining
