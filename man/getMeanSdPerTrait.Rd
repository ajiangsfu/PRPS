\title{Group mean and standard deviation calculation for a given feature}
\usage{
getMeanSdPerTrait(atrait, aweight, fulldat, ratioPrior = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{atrait}{a given feature name}

\item{aweight}{weight for a given feature, only the sign of weight is used in this function}

\item{fulldat}{a data matrix with columns for samples and rows for features}

\item{ratioPrior}{a prior ratio to indicate the ratio of test group over reference group 
regarding mean and sd calculation for each selected feature}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of two group means and sds
}
\description{
This is a function to get group mean and sd for two groups and for a given feature
}
\details{
This is specifically designed for PRPS approach, however, it can be applied for other methods as well when 
group information is unknown, or mean and sd info from previous data can not be used in current data set 
due to data not comparable
