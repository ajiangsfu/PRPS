\item{newdat}{a new data matrix or data frame, columns for samples and rows for features}

\item{weights}{a numeric vector with selected features (as names of the vector) and their weights}

\item{standardization}{a logic variable to indicate if standardization is needed before classification 
score calculation}

\item{classProbCut}{a numeric variable within (0,1), which is a cutoff of Empirical Bayesian probability, 
often used values are 0.8 and 0.9, default value is 0.8. Only one value is used for both groups, 
the samples that are not included in either group will be assigned as UNCLASS}

\item{breaks}{a integer to indicate number of bins in histogram, default is 50}

processed before any other steps, the default is FALSE}

which will use the row data for imputation}

the median value of the chose direction with "byrow" data to be used}

\description{
This is the function to calculate PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score) scores for a testing data set 
without training data set. However, we do need selected feature list with their weights. In addtion, we need mean and sd for two groups for each
selected feature that we need to apply a ratio prior with default as 1/3 to achieve. Once we have PRPS scores, we will use the 
theoretic natual cutoff 0 of PRPS scores to make classification calls, as well as classification calls based on Empirical Bayesian probabilities
with EM (Expectation-Maximization) and with a ratio prior.

\details{
This is the function to calculate PRPS scores and make classification for a testing data set with known weights and a ratio prior of choice.
PRPS calculation is based on Ennishi 2018, its formula is:
\eqn{PRPS(X_i) = \sum (|a_j| log(P1(x_ij)/P0(x_ij)))}
Here, a_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x_ij is the corresponding feature value
 for the ith sample, 
P1 and P0 are the probabilities that the ith sample belongs to two different group.
However, in order to calculate P1 and P0, we need to have two group mean and sd for each selected feature. Although there are multiple way
to obtain these values, in this function, we design to use a ratio prior to achieve group mean and sd, which was used in Ennishi 2018 originally.
After we have have the scores, the natural cutoff of 0 is used to make classification calls as well as empiracal Bayes probability based classification
with the ratio prior.

In addtion, we design to use EM algorithm to get PRPS score mean and sd calculation for the two groups assuming that PRPS score
is a mixture of two normal distributions.

When calculate a Empirical Bayes' probability, we first calcualte probability that a sample belongs to either group,
and then use the following formula to get Empirical Bayes' probability:
\eqn{prob(x) = p_test(x)/(p_test(x) + p_ref(x))}
Here prob(x) is the Empirical Bayes' probability of a given sample, p_test(x) is the probability that a given sample
belongs to the test group, p_ref(x) is the probability that a given sample belongs to the reference group.
Notice that the test and reference group is just the relative grouping, in fact, for this step, we often need
to calculate Empirical Bayes' probabilities for a given sample from two different standing points.

Within this function, standardization step is included as an option to minimize the difference 
between training and testing data sets, be aware that standardization step should be consistent between the data used 
for weight calculation and the testing data set. 
Also, be aware that this step is only done to make distributions of each selected
features comparable. Be aware that this feature-wise standardization cannot make the sample-wise distributions
comparable. For example, if the proportion of one group over all samples might be much lessin the testing data set 
compared to the data that were used for weight generation, or even worse, the testing data set might only contain one classification 
group only, in this case, feature-wise standardization can not solve the comparison problem. 
This is the common problem for classification and feature-wise standardization cannot solve the problem. 
In order to solve the problem, we should make data comparable as much as possbile before classification step.
