\title{PS score calculation for a given sample}
\usage{
getPS1sample(vdat, PSpars)
}
\arguments{
\item{vdat}{a numeric vector of one sample with multiple selected features}

\item{PSpars}{a PS parameter matrix, which rows are the features with the same order as in vdat, 
and the columns are the mean of two group means and weight for each feature}
}
\value{
PS score for a single sample
}
\description{
This is an internal function to calculate PS (Prediction Strength) for a given sample.
}
\details{
PS calculation is based on Golub 1999. In this package, we use four steps to calculate PS scores, 
and this function is for the very last step. 
The four steps are: a) apply "standardize" to standardize input data matrix for each feature; 
b) apply "getTrainingWeights" to select features and return weights for these features; 
c) apply "getMeanOfGroupMeans" to get mean of group means for each selected feature; 
d) use "apply" function to get PS for all samples with this current function "getPS1sample".
NA is ignored for PS calculation.
