\title{Classification Score Calculation}
\usage{
getClassScores(testdat, classMethod = c("LPS", "PRPS", "PS"), weights,
  classMeans, classSds)
}
\arguments{
\item{testdat}{testing data set, a data matrix or a data frame, samples are in columns, and features/genes are in rows}

\item{classMethod}{three choices with defaul "LPS", the other two methods are "PRPS" and "PS"}

\item{weights}{a numeric vector of selected feature weights, which will be used for classfication score calculation,
this is required for all three methods}

\item{classMeans}{a two columns' data frame or data matrix, row names are the selected features that can be matched to testdat, 
columns are for group 1 (the 1st column) and group 0 (the 2nd column), the values are the group means for selected features, 
this is needed for PRPS and PS but not LPS}

\item{classSds}{a two columns' data frame or data matrix, row names are the selected features that can be matched to testdat, 
columns are for group 1 (the 1st column) and group 0 (the 2nd column), the values are the group sds for selected features, 
this is needed for PRPS but not LPS or PS}

\value{
A vector of classification predication score
}
\description{
This function is to calculate classification prediction score with three method choices: 
LPS (defult, Linear Prediction Score) or PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score) or PS (Prediction Strength).
}
\details{
For the default method: LPS, the linear prediction scores are calculated. When PS is chosen, standardization is included 
before score calculation, and we assume that the input of classMeans is also calculated after standardization. 
Notice that this function only issue score values without classification. 
If there are NAs in the data and not imputed before calling this function, these NAs will be ignored for score calculation.
\eqn{LPS(X_i) = \sum a_j x_ij}
Here a_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample.
When PRPS method is selected, probability ratio based classification prediction scores are calculated
\eqn{PRPS(X_i) = \sum (|a_j| log(P1(x_ij)/P0(x_ij)))}
Again, a_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample, 
P1 and P0 are the probabilities that the ith sample belongs to two different group.
When PS method is selected, prediction scores are calculated
\eqn{PS = (V_win âˆ’ V_lose)/(V_win + V_lose)}
Here, where V_win and V_lose are the vote totals for the winning and losing features/genes for a given sample
