#' Classification Score Calculation
#' @description This function is to calculate classification prediction score with three method choices: 
#' LPS (defult, Linear Prediction Score) or PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score) or PS (Prediction Strength). 
#' @details For the default method: LPS, the linear prediction scores are calculated. When PS is chosen, standardization is included 
#' before score calculation, and we assume that the input of classMeans is also calculated after standardization. 
#' Notice that this function only issue score values without classification. 
#' If there are NAs in the data and not imputed before calling this function, these NAs will be ignored for score calculation.
#' \eqn{LPS(X_i) = \sum a_j x_ij}
#' Here a_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample.
#' When PRPS method is selected, probability ratio based classification prediction scores are calculated
#' \eqn{PRPS(X_i) = \sum (|a_j| log(P1(x_ij)/P0(x_ij)))}
#' Again, a_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample, 
#' P1 and P0 are the probabilities that the ith sample belongs to two different group.
#' When PS method is selected, prediction scores are calculated
#' \eqn{PS = (V_win âˆ’ V_lose)/(V_win + V_lose)}
#' Here, where V_win and V_lose are the vote totals for the winning and losing features/genes for a given sample
#' @param testdat testing data set, a data matrix or a data frame, samples are in columns, and features/genes are in rows
#' @param classMethod three choices with defaul "LPS", the other two methods are "PRPS" and "PS"
#' @param weights  a numeric vector of selected feature weights, which will be used for classfication score calculation,
#'  this is required for all three methods
#' @param classMeans  a two columns' data frame or data matrix, row names are the selected features that can be matched to testdat, 
#'  columns are for group 1 (the 1st column) and group 0 (the 2nd column), the values are the group means for selected features, 
#'  this is needed for PRPS and PS but not LPS
#' @param classSds a two columns' data frame or data matrix, row names are the selected features that can be matched to testdat, 
#'  columns are for group 1 (the 1st column) and group 0 (the 2nd column), the values are the group sds for selected features, 
#'  this is needed for PRPS but not LPS or PS
#' @return A vector of classification predication score
