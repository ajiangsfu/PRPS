\begin{Description}\relax
This function is to calculate classification prediction score with three method choices: 
LPS (defult, Linear Prediction Score) or PRPS (Probability ratio based classification predication score) or PS (Prediction Strength).
\end{Description}
%
\begin{Usage}
\begin{verbatim}
getClassScores(testdat, classMethod = c("LPS", "PRPS", "PS"), weights,
  classMeans, classSds)
\end{verbatim}
\end{Usage}
%
\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{testdat}] testing data set, a data matrix or a data frame, samples are in columns, and features/genes are in rows

\item[\code{classMethod}] three choices with defaul "LPS", the other two methods are "PRPS" and "PS"

\item[\code{weights}] a numeric vector of selected feature weights, which will be used for classfication score calculation,
this is required for all three methods

\item[\code{classMeans}] a two columns' data frame or data matrix, row names are the selected features that can be matched to testdat, 
columns are for group 1 (the 1st column) and group 0 (the 2nd column), the values are the group means for selected features, 
this is needed for PRPS and PS but not LPS

\item[\code{classSds}] a two columns' data frame or data matrix, row names are the selected features that can be matched to testdat, 
columns are for group 1 (the 1st column) and group 0 (the 2nd column), the values are the group sds for selected features, 
this is needed for PRPS but not LPS or PS
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
For the default method: LPS, the linear prediction scores are calculated. When PS is chosen, standardization is included 
before score calculation, and we assume that the input of classMeans is also calculated after standardization. 
Notice that this function only issue score values without classification. 
If there are NAs in the data and not imputed before calling this function, these NAs will be ignored for score calculation.
\eqn{LPS(X_i) = \sum a_j x_ij}{}
Here a\_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x\_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample.
When PRPS method is selected, probability ratio based classification prediction scores are calculated
\eqn{PRPS(X_i) = \sum (|a_j| log(P1(x_ij)/P0(x_ij)))}{}
Again, a\_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x\_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample, 
P1 and P0 are the probabilities that the ith sample belongs to two different group.
When PS method is selected, prediction scores are calculated
\eqn{PS = (V_win âˆ’ V_lose)/(V_win + V_lose)}{}
Here, where V\_win and V\_lose are the vote totals for the winning and losing features/genes for a given sample

%
\begin{Details}\relax
The coding is written based on Wright 2003 for LPS (linear predication score) approach, 
but it can be used for other appraoches such as PS and PRPS as well. 
For LPS, the probability step is required since LPS itself does not have a natural cutoff for classification, 
alternatively, if the testing and training data arec comparable, we can also make classification based on LPS cutoffs 
but this is not commonly used. For PS and PRPS, 0 is a natural cutoff for two group classification, however, 
this probability step is still useful if we allow UNCLASS group in the final classification besides the two types 
of classes from the training.
When calculate a Empirical Bayes' probability, the 1st group in the input mean and sd vectors is treated as the test group. 
When calculate the probabilities, we first calcualte probability that a sample belongs to either group, and then:
\eqn{prob(x) = p_test(x)/(p_test(x) + p_ref(x))}{}
Here prob(x) is the Empirical Bayes' probability of a given sample, p\_test(x) is the probability that a given sample 
belongs to the test group, p\_ref(x) is the probability that a given sample belongs to the reference group.
Notice that the test and reference group is just the relative grouping, in fact, for this step, 
we often need to calculate Empirical Bayes' probabilities for a given sample from two different standing points.
If you need to calculate Empirical Bayes' probabilities of a group of samples, "apply" function is needed to get all done.

b) apply "getTrainingWeights" to select features and return weights for these features; 
c) apply "getMeanOfGroupMeans" to get mean of group means for each selected feature; 
d) use "apply" function to get PS for all samples with this current function "getPS1sample".
NA is ignored for PS calculation.

\begin{Details}\relax
Within the five weight calculation methods, "limma","ttest", "PearsonR","SpearmanR" are often used and nothing 
is changed for them from usual setting in this function. We describe more detail about "MannWhitneyU" here. 
Mann-Whitney U test is a well known rank based two group comparison test method, but its statistics value U is not easy 
to use for weight. U can be calculated in two different ways depending on which group we stand for. 
Assuming that there are two groups with sample sizes n1 and n2, and rank sum for the two groups are R1 and R2, 
then we can have the following two U values:
\eqn{ U_1 = R_1 - n_1(n_1 + 1)/2}{}
\eqn{ U_2 = R_2 - n_2(n_2 + 1)/2}{}
In this function, we use the test group (non reference group) to calculate U value, and then calculate 
its rank-biserial correlation with the following formula:
\eqn{ r = 1 - 2U/(n_1 * n_2)}{}
P value for "MannWhitneyU", however, is still based on standard Mann - Whitney U test.
NA is ignored before testing.

\item[\code{dataIn}] a data matrix or a data frame, samples are in columns, and features/genes are in rows

\item[\code{byrow}] although we recommend to impute NAs along with features, but this function can be used for either direction,
the default value is byrow = TRUE

\item[\code{imputeValue}] for classification, the most non-informatic value is median/mean in a given row/column,

\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
During the classification score calculation process, NA offen causes troubles especially when matrix multiplication is involved. 
To avoid this problem, we suggest to impute NA values before any other functions are called if you have NA in your data. 
For classification purpose, the median value is believed to be most noninformative value, so we use median to replace NA. Further more, 
we prefer to do feature-wise median replacement although this function can be applied in both feature wise and sample wise replacements.

\begin{Details}\relax
This is the function to calculate LPS scores and make classification and 
Empirical Bayesian probabilities for a testing new data set. However, this new data set should be 
comparable to the training data set that generates prior parameters as much as possible. When the testing data set is not comparable
to the training data set, calibration might be needed before calling this function. 
Within this LPStesting function, standardization step is included as an option to minimize the difference 
between training and testing data sets, be aware that standardization step should be consistent between training and testing data sets. 
Also, be aware that this step is only done to make distributions of each selected
features comparable. Be aware that this feature-wise standardization cannot make the sample-wise distributions
comparable. For example, the training data set must have two classification groups, however, 
the proportion of one group sample might be much less than the other group in the testing data set 
compared to the training data set, or even worse, the testing data set might only contain one classification 
group only. This is the common problem for classification and feature-wise standardization cannot solve the problem. 
In order to solve the problem, we should make data comparable as much as possbile before classification step, for example, calibration as mentioned above. 
LPS calculation is based on Wright 2003. The fomula is straightforward:
\eqn{LPS(X) = \sum a_j x_ij}{}
Here a\_j represents the jth selected feature weights, and x\_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample.
\eqn{PRPS(X_i) = \sum (|a_j| log(P1(x_ij)/P0(x_ij)))}{}
When calculate a Empirical Bayes' probability, the 1st group in the input mean and sd vectors is treated as the 
test group. When calculate the probabilities, we first calcualte probability that a sample belongs to either group,
and then use the following formula to get Empirical Bayes' probability:
\eqn{prob(x) = p_test(x)/(p_test(x) + p_ref(x))}{}
Here prob(x) is the Empirical Bayes' probability of a given sample, p\_test(x) is the probability that a given sample
belongs to the test group, p\_ref(x) is the probability that a given sample belongs to the reference group.
Notice that the test and reference group is just the relative grouping, in fact, for this step, we often need
to calculate Empirical Bayes' probabilities for a given sample from two different standing points.

When we calculate a Empirical Bayes' probability, the 1st group in the input mean and sd vectors is treated
as the test group. 
When we calculate the probabilities, we first calcualte probability that a sample belongs to either group, 
and then use the 
following formula to get Empirical Bayes' probability:
\eqn{prob(x) = p_test(x)/(p_test(x) + p_ref(x))}{}
Here prob(x) is the Empirical Bayes' probability of a given sample, p\_test(x) is the probability
that a given sample belongs to the test group, p\_ref(x) is the probability that a given sample belongs
to the reference group.
Notice that the test and reference group is just the relative grouping, in fact, for this step, 
we often need to calculate Empirical Bayes' probabilities for a given sample from two different standing points.
c) This function also give classification for the training group and confusion matrix to compare PRPS classification
with original group info for training data set.
If NAs are not imputed, they are ignored for feature selection, weight calculation, PRPS parameter estimation, 
and PRPS calculation.

\begin{Value}
A list with three items is returned: PRPS parameters for selected features, PRPS scores and classifications for training samples, and confusion matrix to compare classification based on PRPS scores and original classification.
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{PRPS\_pars}] a list of 3 items, the 1st item is a data frame with weights and group testing results of each selected features for PRPS calculation, the 2nd item is a numeric vector containing PRPS mean and sd for two groupsï¼Œand the 3rd item is a data frame contains mean and sd for each group and for each selected feature
\item[\code{PRPS\_train}] a data frame of PRPS score, true classification, Empirical Bayesian probabilites for both groups, and its classification for all training samples, notice that there are two ways for classifications, one is based on probabilities, and there is UNCLASS group besdies the given two groups, alternatively, the other one is based on PRPS scores directly and 0 treated as a natural cutoff
\item[\code{classCompare}] a confusion matrix list object that compare PRPS classification based on selected features and weights compared to input group classification for training data set, notice that the samples with UNCLASS are excluded since confusion matrix can not compare 3 groups to 2 groups

%
\begin{Details}\relax
This is the function to calculate PS scores and make classification for a testing new data set. 
However, this new data set should be comparable to the training data set as much as possible. 
Within PStraining and within this current PStesting functions, standardization step is included
to minimize the difference between training and testing data sets, but this step is only done to
make distributions of each selected features comparable. Be aware that this feature-wise 
standardization cannot make the sample-wise distributions comparable. 
For example, the training data set must have two classification groups, however, the proportion of 
one group sample might be much less than the other group in the testing data set compared to the 
training data set, or even worse, the testing data set might only contain one classification group only. 
This is the common problem for classification and feature-wise standardization cannot solve the problem. 
In order to solve the problem, we should make data comparable as much as possbile before classification step.
For example, use the same pre-processing settings and make suitable batch effect correction. 
For classification with PS approach, we also suggest to combine traing and testing data together as "newdat"
for this PStesting function, to avoid forcing two groups' classification while there is actual only one group
in the testing group.

\begin{Details}\relax
PS calculation is based on Golub 1999. In this warp up function, we use four steps to calculate 
PS scores and classification. The range of PS scores is [-1,1]. Before these four steps, we also give an option
for NA imputation. The four steps are:
a) apply "standardize" to standardize input data matrix for each feature;
b) apply "getTrainingWeights" to select features and return weights for these features;
c) apply "getMeanOfGroupMeans" to get mean of group means for each selected feature;
d) use "apply" function to get PS scores for all samples with "getPS1sample", the formula is:
\eqn{PS = (V_win âˆ’ V_lose)/(V_win + V_lose)}{}
Here, where V\_win and V\_lose are the vote totals for the winning and losing features/traits for a given sample
This function also give classification for the training group and confusion matrix to compare PS classification
with original group info for training data set.
If NAs are not imputed, they are ignored for feature selection, weight calculation, PS parameter estimation,
and PS calculation.

\begin{Arguments}
\begin{ldescription}
\item[\code{dataIn}] a data matrix or a data frame, samples are in columns, and features/genes are in rows

\item[\code{byrow}] although we recommend to standardize data along with features, 
but this function can be used for either direction, the default value is byrow = TRUE
\end{ldescription}
\end{Arguments}
%
\begin{Details}\relax
Standardization is the standard way to make data comparable. For this package, 
this should be done right after imputeNAs if necessary. In general, 
we do not recommend this step before classification, however, if the training and testing data sets
are obviously not comparable, we suggest to standardize training and testing data separately for each gene. 
It should be aware that this step might inflate sample differences for the low expression genes.
Standardization is done as:
\eqn{ X = (X-mean(X))/sd(X) }{}
In this step, NA are removed from mean and sd calculation, which means that this step is safe even imputeNAs is not done before this step when they are NAs in the data.

\#'  PRPS calculation is based on Ennishi 2018. The fomula is 
\eqn{PRPS(X) = \sum a_j x_ij}{}
Here, a\_j represents the jth selected feature weightss, and x\_ij is the corresponding feature value for the ith sample, P1 and P0 are the probabilities that the ith sample belongs to two different group.
When calculate a Empirical Bayes' probability, the 1st group in the input mean and sd vectors is treated as
the test group. 
If there are NAs in the data and not imputed before calling this function, these NAs will be ignored for PRPS score calculation.
If you want to call this function directly, make sure to give all values for its parameters. If you do not have PRPStraining object
but would like to calculate PRPS scores, this is function is much easier to use than PRPStesting, and this function is 
identical if you work on PRPS approach.
